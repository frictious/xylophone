This is a project that plays one of seven different .wav sounds based on what which of the seven buttons you click on in the app.

It was a project on Angela Yu's flutter course. I've modified mine to display random colors anytime you reload the app based on seven colors I've selected. The .wav sounds also randomly associate themselves to the seven buttons
